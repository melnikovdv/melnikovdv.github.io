This is a nice book to dive into reactive programming concepts. Before this book I've read several posts about reactive extensions (RX), I've looked at the [http://reactivex.io/](http://reactivex.io/) itself, but information was difficult to understand without academic approach and useful examples.

I've found this book in September, 2015. And have chosen it for several reasons:

* it was recently published, so could contain actual data,
* it's quite small,
* it has set of [github materials](https://github.com/meddle0x53/learning-rxjava) with samples.

And it helped me to caught the idea of RX. I can't say that it's perfect, but small and useful for consistent knowledge.
