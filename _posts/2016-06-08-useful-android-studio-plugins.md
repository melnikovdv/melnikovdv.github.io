I've discovered two helpful Android Studio plugins that I haven't used before. 

The first one is [ADB Idea](https://github.com/pbreault/adb-idea). It can clear your app's data with jus one click or command straight from your IDE. 

The second one is [Settings Repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/plugins/settings-repository). It helps to share your IDE settings among your computers or among your colleagues. So, if you forget where some tricky check-buttons to find from time to time, use it. Create Github repo e.g. and setup it just from splash screen of your Idea base IDE.
