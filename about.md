My name is Dmitriy Melnikov. 

As I already told, I write code and I like it. My interests are Android and Scala, but I'm curious in other modern technologies too.

Check out my [CV][cv] and feel free to [mail][mail] me.

Besides IT my passion is swing dancing. Especially I fond of rock'n'roll music and boogie-woogie dance. Also I'm one of co-founders of a small dance club (or a dance school if you want) <a href="http://coolandcrazy.ru/">Cool&Crazy</a>.
